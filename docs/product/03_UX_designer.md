# User Interface Description Document

## Layout Structure
The primary layout will feature a clear separation between the natural language input area and the visual workflow builder. The input field will likely be at the top or in a prominent sidebar. The main content area will be dedicated to the dynamic workflow diagram, allowing users to see their automation take shape in real-time. A separate panel or modal will be used for step-by-step editing, clarification dialogs, and debugging tools.

## Core Components
- Natural Language Input Field: A large text area for users to type their workflow descriptions.
- Workflow Diagram Canvas: An interactive area displaying the nodes and connections of the workflow.
- Step Editor Panel: A form-based interface to configure triggers, actions, and conditions for individual workflow steps.
- Clarification Dialogs: Pop-up windows or inline elements to ask users for more specific information.
- Integration/Connector Manager: An interface to browse, add, and configure connections to external services.
- Testing and Debugging Console: An area to run tests, view sample data, and simulate actions.
- Version History/Undo-Redo Controls: Buttons or a dedicated panel for managing workflow versions.

## Interaction Patterns
- Typing in the natural language input triggers real-time updates to the workflow diagram.
- Clicking on a node in the workflow diagram opens the step editor panel.
- Drag and drop functionality may be used to rearrange steps or add new ones from a palette.
- Dialogs will appear contextually based on ambiguous input or configuration needs.
- Users will interact with forms and dropdowns within the step editor to configure details.

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme
The visual design should be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly, minimizing clutter to focus on the workflow creation process. A neutral background with accent colors to highlight interactive elements and different types of workflow nodes (triggers, actions, conditions) would be effective. Color coding could also be used to indicate the status of workflow steps (e.g., configured, incomplete, error).

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop Considerations
- Web App: This will likely be the primary platform, requiring a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Desktop: A dedicated desktop application could offer better performance and deeper integration with local files and applications. The layout can take advantage of larger screen real estate.
- Mobile: A mobile interface might focus on monitoring existing workflows, receiving notifications, and perhaps simple editing, rather than complex creation due to screen size limitations.

## Typography
A clear, readable sans-serif font should be used for all text elements. Font sizes should be adjusted for readability across different devices and screen sizes.

## Accessibility
The UI should adhere to WCAG guidelines. This includes providing sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation support, ARIA labels for screen readers, and resizable text. Error messages and clarification prompts should be clear and easy to understand.
