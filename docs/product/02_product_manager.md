# Product Requirements Document

## Elevator Pitch
A natural language workflow creation tool that allows users to describe desired automations in plain English, which are then automatically converted into executable workflows with real-time building, testing, and integration capabilities via MCP servers.

## Who is this app for
This app is for individuals and businesses who want to automate tasks and workflows without needing technical expertise in traditional programming or complex automation platforms. It targets users who prefer describing their needs in natural language.

## Functional Requirements
- Provide a natural language input field for workflow description.
- Parse natural language input to extract workflow steps (trigger, actions, conditions).
- Implement live parsing and step extraction to convert natural language into a structured format.
- Utilize clarification dialogs to resolve ambiguous user intent.
- Perform intent detection and entity extraction to identify tools, triggers, data, and outputs.
- Generate and display a real-time visual workflow diagram.
- Offer a step-by-step builder view for editing workflow steps.
- Support the creation of multi-step workflows with branching and conditions.
- Implement version history and undo/redo functionality for workflow changes.
- Provide a live testing mode with sample data.
- Develop a workflow runtime and trigger execution engine for real-time monitoring and execution.
- Include a built-in sandbox for debugging and simulating actions.
- Offer prebuilt connectors for common tools (Slack, Google Sheets, Email, Trello, Airtable, Discord, Notion, etc.).
- Integrate with external services via MCP servers.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to describe my desired workflow in natural language so that the system can automatically create it for me.
- As a user, I want the system to ask me clarifying questions if my workflow description is unclear so that the generated workflow is accurate.
- As a user, I want to see a visual representation of my workflow as I describe it so that I can easily understand its structure.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit individual steps of my workflow so that I can fine-tune the automation.
- As a user, I want to be able to create complex workflows with multiple steps and conditions so that I can automate intricate processes.
- As a user, I want to be able to test my workflow before deploying it to ensure it works correctly.
- As a user, I want my workflows to run automatically in real-time based on defined triggers.
- As a user, I want to be able to connect my workflows to various external tools and services.

## User Interface
The user interface should include:
- A prominent natural language input field.
- A dynamic area displaying the visual workflow diagram.
- An editable step-by-step view of the workflow.
- Dialogs for clarification and configuration.
- Elements for accessing version history and undo/redo.
- Controls for live testing and debugging.
- An interface for managing integrations and connectors.
