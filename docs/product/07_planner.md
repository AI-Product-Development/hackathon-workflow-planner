- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for integration management (Medium)

## Work Stream: Natural Language Parsing & Execution

- [ ] Implement basic natural language parsing logic (initial version) (Complex)
- [ ] Design and implement Pydantic models for parsing request and response (Easy)
- [ ] Implement test parsing endpoint (`POST /test/parse/`) (Medium)
- [ ] Implement basic workflow execution logic (interpreting structured definition) (Complex)
- [ ] Implement backend logic to call MCP server tools during workflow execution. (Complex)
- [ ] Implement backend logic to access MCP server resources during workflow execution. (Complex)

- [ ] Integrate frontend with backend API for workflow creation and listing (Medium)
- [ ] Implement basic workflow listing and viewing UI (Medium)
- [ ] Implement basic workflow creation from natural language input (connecting to `/test/parse/` and `/workflows/`) (Complex)
- [ ] Implement basic UI for managing user integrations with MCP servers (listing, adding). (Medium)
- [ ] Refine UI/UX based on initial testing (Medium)
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of core workflows (Complex)
