## ðŸ’¡ What Are We Building?

The goal is to create a **Workflow Planner Assistant** that empowers users to:
- Plan projects and tasks using natural language
- Break down goals into logical, achievable steps
- Suggest tools, resources, and dependencies
- Visualize workflows as editable diagrams or boards
- Reorganize and adapt workflows based on feedback or changes
- Save and share workflows for others to use or remix

This tool aims to support everyone from creators and teams to solo founders and learners who want a smarter, AI-supported planning process.
